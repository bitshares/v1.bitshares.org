<h5>BitShares 101: Basics of the World's 4th Most Popular Cryptocurrency</h5>
   <p>Functionality – the key functionality of Bitcoin and most of its clones is, in essence, a new form of checking account that has no counterparty risk. BitShares goes beyond that basic service to provide a wide range of other counterparty-free financial services. BitShares takes Bitcoin’s concept of an incorruptible public ledger and applies it to many profitable business models.

<h5>BitSharesX Price Soars</h5>
   <p>The BitSharesX price has gone on an absolute tear over the past week. After hovering between 1,500 and 2,000 satoshis (~$.01 USD) since its release on July 21, the BitSharesX price has increased by 151.6% over the past week. The BitSharesX price is currently more than 4,900 satoshis ($.025), according to CoinGecko. However, as the chart below demonstrates, the BitSharesX price has fallen about 8% over the past 24 hours.

       <p>Imagine a corporation that engages in economic activity without guidance or direction from humans. Programmed with a mission statement—maximize profit for shareholders from the sale of widgets, for example—the corporation could own capital, enter contracts, and employ robots. People could even be hired for more creative tasks. Such an entity would live on the Internet, distributed across thousands or millions of nodes

      <h5>Kickstarter Coins</h5>
         <p>Crowdfunding has become increasingly popular over the last few years and the market somewhat saturated. One of the problems of crowdfunding is if you don’t need or want the reward offered in exchange for your donation, there isn’t much incentive to support a project. This is a problem we can change, and by doing so reinvent cryptocurrency as we know it. I’ll also describe “The Startup” that I believe many people will eventually

         <p>Bitcoin is very much in the news. In fact, recent headlines — that the Bitcoin system has experienced a fair number of “heists” lately, combined with the Chinese government’s decision to ban banks from trading in the ephemeral digital currency — combine to make this the topic of the day.   Cyber utopians raise Bitcoin as an example of how secret transactions can still take place, even in an increasingly transparent world

  <h5>The Implications of Crypto Assets Part 3: Distributed Autonomous Corporations</h5>
     <p>In part two of this series on crypto assets, we discussed all of the implications for decentralized exchanges and blurring the line between IPO’s and crowdfunding.  Those concepts are definitely exciting, but not as exciting as distributed autonomous corporations (DACs). It’s amazing that anyone in the world will soon be able to issue their own IPO without any filter or fee, but what if the company that was going public was also

      <h5>Bitcoin: It’s the platform, not the currency, stupid!</h5>
         <p>In their book “The Second Machine Age” (2014) authors Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson, both at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), argue how the history of work can be described by the role that automation has played.  They distinguish between two periods. In the First Machine Age, the Industrial Revolution, technology reinforces human muscle power. These machines are controlled by humans.
